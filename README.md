================================

A JSP diagrammer and Cobol interpreter for the Atari ST

Back in 1989 this was my University Honours project. 

It was a crude JSP diagrammer with a built in COBOL interpreter - because they were future in 1989.

This is the end result code, I've lost the early code. Because some of the diagrammer was actually bootstrapped from a set of JSP diagrams, which I ran through a COBOL-to-C translator (because the JSP diagrammers only output COBOL, and I was writing in C).

I've lost the latex files for the project report, otherwise I would upload those as well.
